 How to Use 0-add_integer.py
============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``add_integer(a, b=98)``.

Numbers
=======

``add_integer(a, b=98)`` returns the product of its arguments.  For numbers,
that value is equivalent to using the ``+`` operator.

::

    >>> from 0-add_integer import add_integer(a, b=98)
    >>> my_function(2, 3)
    6

It also works with floating-point values.

::

    >>> my_function(2.0, 3)
    6.0
